= Does this plugin accept reservation online payments? =
Yes, you can accept payments for bookings through WooCommerce. Booking Activities is perfectly integrated to WooCommerce:

* Booking forms will appears automatically on product pages 
* A cart expiration system is implemented to make sure that bookings in the shopping basket won't stay in the basket forever, taking the place of someone else
* Bookings are automatically validated when the payment is received, or cancelled if not
* If you change order quantity or state, so do the bookings, and vice versa


= Should I accept payments for bookings? =
Here is a pros and cons analysis:

**PROS:**

* Customers are engaged, if they book, they come.
* Saves time: customers have already paid.
* Customers can come without money, they can offer the activity to a relative
* Automatic cashing, billing, accounting and stats

**CONS:**

* May discourage customers, depending on the type of activity you provide and your target
* Takes more time for customers, and more diffult process, higher cart abandonment rate
* You will have to do much more development, administrative and legal procedures, and you will have more expenses (bank commission, maintenance ...)

We recommend to accept online payments since it's a great way to automate your business management and make it grow.


= Events are not "Booked" after booking form submission, they are "Pending", why? =
Don't worry, the reservation is well registered. Now, it is up to you to turn it to "Booked" right away or when your customer comes, or when your customer gives you the money...
But you can just turn the default booking status to "Booked" in Booking Activities settings.
Note that if you use WooCommerce and online payments, booking status turn automatically to "Booked" if the payment is complete, or "Cancelled" if not.


= Cart expires but events are still booked = 
A bot cleans expired bookings hourly. So just wait up to 1 hour.
Usually, users are still on your website when their bookings expire, if so, they are immediatly removed.
Else, they will be cancelled later, with the others in that case.


= My events appear to be booked, but no bookings appear in the list =
Temporary bookings (such as In cart events) take active slots but may not appear in the booking list.
Go to the "Bookings" page, under the "States" filter select "Delivered", "Booked", "Pending" and "In cart".
Then, just click on "Apply Filters". Now you can see all kind of active bookings.


= Cancelled bookings disapeared from the list, I need to see them! =
Go to the "Bookings" page. Under the "States" filter, select all the available status.
Click on "Apply Filters" and then you will be able to see inactive bookings (cancelled, expired, removed, refunded, refund requested).


= Email notifications are not sent =
If you enabled "Asynchronous email" option in Booking Activities settings ("Notifications" tab), emails will be sent the next time someone (anyone) loads any page of your website.
Then, you only need to refresh or visit any page of your website and then check your inbox.
If you disable "Asynchronous email" option, then the loading will last until the email is actually sent.


= Ask for support = 
**We answer within 48h**. You can contact us in many ways:
- By email at [contact@booking-activities.fr](mailto:contact@booking-activities.fr)
- On [WordPress support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/booking-activities)

5. Create and customize your booking form. You can combine events and settings of multiple schedules. You can make each form unique.

9. Easily bind a reservation form to a WooCommerce product. You can set a different event calendar to each variation.
